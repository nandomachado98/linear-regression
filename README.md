# Linear Regression

## Project Overview
We will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.

### Data Description

The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

### Procediments

1. Implement Gradient Descent
2 . Update Equations
  a. Minimize the cost function

  b. Where the hypothesis is given by the linear model

### Results

At the end, we'll have a model that predicts the profit for a food truck, considering the population of the city it resides
